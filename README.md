### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack software engineer in Austin, TX. I love asking questions, solving problems, and collaborating with a team!
- ðŸ”­  Working on multiple frontend and backend projects using React and Nodejs
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I love reading a good historical fiction or fantasy novel (but secretly I find a lot of enjoyment in doing my own nails!)
